Generate Profile for team members


# Team Viewer

The primary purpose of this project hey Siri define the application that allows a user to enter teams information within the command line prompt using inquirer this  information is supposed to be stored with a class then displayed within an html file.



 My ideal html look like this:

<img src = "./assets/images/plan_for_html.jpg" width="45%" height="65%" style="width:100%;max-width:250px;display:block;margin:0 auto;"> 

Due to time, I thought it would be ideal for me to list what this project is missing and refactor the code throughout the quarter:



## 1. Command Line Questions
Dynamically ask questions to the user regarding teams information in that after the manager’s information is given, the option to either answer questions about the intern or engineer or leave the application. If the user wants to answer questions regarding the engineer then afterwards the user is prompt either to answer questions about the intern or leave. If the user wants to answer questions about the intern after the manager, once done the program exits.


## 2. Make another Class
Create an input class that stores the user’s information so that it could be called within the index.js file.


## 3. Enhance HTML and CSS 
Make my html file prettier! I would also want to add the feature regarding emails for managers and allow the user to go to the engineers GitHub account.
